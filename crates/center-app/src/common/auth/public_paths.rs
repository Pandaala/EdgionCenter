//! Canonical source of truth for "public" (unauthenticated) HTTP paths.
//!
//! These paths are referenced by both the authentication layer (`unified_auth`)
//! and the authorization layer (`authz_middleware`), plus config validation and
//! config defaults. Centralizing them here prevents the three-way drift that
//! previously let a fail-closed authz change 403 the public `/health` probe.
//!
//! # Security boundary (fr-cauth-01)
//!
//! The authentication skip-set is `static base ∪ operator-configured skip_paths`
//! (operators may extend it within an allowlist). The authorization skip-set is
//! the **static base ONLY** — never the operator-configured set, otherwise a
//! business route added to `skip_paths` would bypass authorization. The helpers
//! below expose the static base; callers that need the dynamic union add the
//! operator config on top themselves.
