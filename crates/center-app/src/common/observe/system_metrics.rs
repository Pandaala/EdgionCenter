//! System-level error state metrics.
//!
//! A single registry for "system-level" degraded states across Edgion
//! binaries (Gateway, Controller, Center). Emits a Prometheus gauge that
//! stays at `1` while a degraded mode is active, so operators can wire
//! an Alertmanager rule like:
//!
//! ```text
//! edgion_system_error_state > 0 for 5m
//! ```
//!
//! This is *observability* only — the metric does not change the system's
//! runtime behavior. It exists so a deliberately-insecure or degraded
//! operational mode (e.g., `skip_tls` bypass, future similar toggles)
//! surfaces in monitoring even when operators stop reading startup logs.
//!
//! **Label discipline**: `component` and `reason` must both come from the
//! bounded constants in `components` and `reasons` below — never pass raw
//! config values or free-form strings (Prometheus cardinality risk).
