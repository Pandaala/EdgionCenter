# 06 Center Architecture (edgion-center)

Center is the federation hub for multi-cluster Edgion deployments.
It accepts bidirectional gRPC streams from one or more Controllers, aggregates the
PluginMetaData they publish, and exposes an HTTP Admin API for operators.
Entry point: `src/main.rs`; startup logic: `src/cli/mod.rs` (`EdgionCenterCli::run`).

## Mental model

```
Controller A ──┐
Controller B ──┼── gRPC FederationSync (:12251) ──► Center ──► HTTP Admin API (:12201)
Controller C ──┘     (bidirectional stream)           │
                                                       └── SQLite (controller registry)
```

Center is the *server* side of `FederationSync`; each Controller is a *client* that
dials in and sends a `RegisterRequest`, then receives `FedWatchRequest` messages
(Center → Controller direction) and responds with watch data.
This is the *reverse* of the typical K8s informer pattern: Center issues the watch,
Controllers are the data sources.

## Authentication note

Center authentication is **mandatory** (no-auth mode removed 2026-05-24). Center has **no
auto-generated credentials** — if neither `[local_auth]` nor `[auth]` is configured, all
business routes return 503 fail-close at startup (a WARN is logged); `/health`, `/ready`,
`/metrics`, and `/api/v1/auth/status` remain reachable. `enabled: false` is ignored with
a WARN. Center has **no authz/RBAC engine**: the `(verb, kind)` authorization engine is
Controller-private; Center is authentication-only (shared `unified_auth`).
